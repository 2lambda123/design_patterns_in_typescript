# Design Patterns in TypeScript #

Here are the implementations of the following design patterns in TypeScript:

### Creational ###

* [Singleton](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/singleton)
* [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/abstract_factory)
* [Factory Method](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/factory_method)
* [Builder](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/builder)
* [Prototype](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/prototype)


### Structural Patterns ###

* [Adapter](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/adapter)
* [Bridge](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/bridge)
* [Composite](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/composite)
* [Decorator](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/decorator)
* [Facade](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/facade)
* [Flyweight](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/flyweight)
* [Proxy](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/proxy)


### Behavioral Patterns ###

* [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/chain_of_responsibility)
* [Command](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/command)
* [Interpreter](https://github.com/torokmark/design_patterns_in_typescript/tree/master/interpreter)
